Javascript Password Generator

This program activates upon pressing the red button. It will send 2 prompts. The first requesting how many characters the password should be (between 8 and 128), and the second with 4 options tied to numbers. These numbers can be entered in any order or format (1234 = 4,3,2,1 = 2 1 4 3). It will then leave the password in the box above the red button.
